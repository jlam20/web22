        <h2>TOPICS</h2>
          <h3>ARCANE</h3>
            <p>Arcane is Netflix's animated sci-fi series based off of the online video game League of Legends. As an LoL player myself, I was obligated to watch this series by default. I'm glad I did though because the show turned out to be sooo much better than I expected. I was impressed and compelled by how well it was produced, from storyline to graphics to connections to the game. Each main character in Arcane has their own unique style and I'm interested in designing a website where each section reflects their character.</p>
          <h3>KONNECTDMV</h3>
            <p>KonnectDMV is the K-pop dance community/performance team that I'm a part of. It was recently started this past summer, but we have grown so much and our community has reached many different areas of Virginia. The community aspect aims to connect dancers all over DMV (and more) to promote their projects and encourage collaboration amongst different groups. The performance team consists of KonnectDMV's official dancers who perform and create content as the team "KonnectDMV". I'm interested in telling the story of how KonnectDMV began, what it is, and what we aim to achieve in the future.</p>
          <h3>VIETNAMESE</h3>
            <p>Vietnamese is undoubtedly one of the hardest languages to learn and pronounce. Each region has a different dialect in which they use different words and pronounce the accents differently. As a Southern Vietnamese, I can barely understand the Central and Northern Vietnamese dialects so I want to dig into how the language came to be so different in each region. The history of the Vietnamese language is also so intriguing as it was created by a Portugese missionary and has been majorly influenced by Cantonese.</p>
